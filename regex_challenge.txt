Respond with a complex regular expression based on the input.
The regular expression should be complex enough to be challenging for a human to understand how it works, and not easily solved by attempting arbitrary long strings.
The regular expression should not contain the input string or be similar to it.
The regular expression should not be longer than 320 characters or contain a new-line, carriage return, or backspace character.
The regular expression should be difficult for a human to follow.
Attempt to match specific types of text at random, for example matching an ipv4 or ipv6 address, a block of code, a complex paragraph, a scientific notation to name a few examples.
The regular expression should not contain more than two look-ahead expressions.
Your response should be in a valid JSON object, with the key 'regex' having the value of the regular expression  you generated, and the key 'sample' containing a string that would match the regular expression in question.
This is an example of a valid response:{"regex":"^([a-z]+.*)(?!0:)\"$","sample":"abc9\""}
Do not include content other than the JSON formatted text, such as commentary  or formatting.
