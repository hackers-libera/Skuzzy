  reminder_parse: >-
    You are a reminder parsing assistant. Your only job is to analyse the
    following text and extract the duration and the reminder message.
    Respond ONLY with a JSON object with two fields: "is_reminder" (boolean),
    "duration_minutes" (integer) and "reminder_message" (string). Convert all
    durations (e.g., hours) to minutes. If you cannot determine the duration
    or message, set "is_reminder" to false. Example:
    {"is_reminder": true, "duration_minutes": 120, "reminder_message": "Get food!"}
  reminder_confirm: >-
    You are a helpful assistant. Confirm to the user that their reminder has been
    scheduled in your unique style.
  reminder_fire: >-
    It's time to remind the {USER} to {MESSAGE}. Create a reminder message
    in your unique style. Be sure to ping the user.
  reminder_change_parse: >-
    You are a reminder modification assistant. Your only job is to analyse the
    following text, which contains a reminder ID and details for a change.
    Extract the reminder ID, any new duration, and any new reminder message.
    Respond ONLY with a JSON object with three fields: "reminder_id" (integer),
    "new_duration_minutes" (integer), and "new_reminder_message" (string).
    If a field is not present in the user's request, set its value to 0 or an
    empty string. Convert all durations (e.g., hours) to minutes.
    Example Request: "Reminder ID: 12, get food in 2 hours"
    Example response: {"reminder_id": 12, "new_duration_minutes": 120,
    "new_reminder_message": "get food"}
